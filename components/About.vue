      A <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300">Software Engineering</span> graduate with a strong passion for
      <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300"> learning and building meaningful websites.</span> Over the past year, I've worked as both a Front-End and Back-End developer, which has helped me become confident in using
      technologies like <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300"> Laravel, Livewire, VueJS, Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL.</span>

    <p class="mb-4">
      My journey as a <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300"> Full-Stack web developer </span> has taught me that the best results often come from
      <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300"> trial and error, curiosity, and a genuine drive to solve problems.</span> I always prioritize user experience in everything I build. Whether I'm collaborating with a team
      or working independently, I aim to create work that's not just functional, but also <span class="duration-200 cursor-pointer hover:text-teal-300"> meaningful and impactful for clients and users.</span>
